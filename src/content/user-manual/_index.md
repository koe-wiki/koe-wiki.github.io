Koe features tools for visualising, segmenting, measuring, classifying, data-filtering and exporting acoustic units, and analysing sequence structure (syntax). It is an end-to-end acoustic database solution, especially suitable for animal species with distinct acoustic units.

You can use it on any device at [koe.io.ac.nz](https://koe.io.ac.nz), which makes it ideal for collaboration, education, and citizen science.
