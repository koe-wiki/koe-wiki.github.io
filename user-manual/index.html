<p><em><strong>Koe</strong></em> <strong>is open-source web-based software for analysing animal vocalisations.</strong></p>
<p>Read the  <em>Methods in Ecology and Evolution</em> paper <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13336">here</a>. <strong>Please cite this paper if you publish using <em>Koe</em></strong></p>
<p>It features tools for visualising, segmenting, measuring, classifying, data-filtering and exporting acoustic units, and analysing sequence structure (syntax). It is an end-to-end acoustic database solution, especially suitable for animal species with distinct acoustic units.</p>
<p>You can use it on any device at <a href="https://koe.io.ac.nz">koe.io.ac.nz</a>, which makes it ideal for collaboration, education, and citizen science.</p>
<p>For a quick overview and demonstration of program features, see this video:</p>

<h1 id="why-use-_koe_">Why use <em>Koe</em>?</h1>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
<p>Acoustic communication is fundamental to the behaviour of many species. If we want to understand animal behaviour we need tools that allow us to objectively examine the details of vocalisations. What information are they sharing, and how is it encoded?</p>
<p>Often, acoustic communication is structured as a temporal sequence of distinct acoustic units (e.g. syllables), where information is encoded in the <em>types</em> of units and sometimes their <em>temporal arrangement</em> (syntax). In such cases, this is the flowchart for acoustic analysis:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YXmS36F/bioacoustic-process-pp.png" alt="Bioacoustics process"></p>
<p>Classification is a key step, because once you have a dataset of labelled units, you can analyse repertoire size and sequence structure and compare between individuals, sexes, sites, and seasons.</p>
<p>Manual classification by human eye and ear remains the primary and most reliable method for most species, but is hindered by a lack of tools, especially for large and diverse datasets.</p>
<p>That’s where <em>Koe</em> comes in. By facilitating large-scale, high-resolution classification and analysis of acoustic units, <em>Koe</em> opens up many possibilities for bioacoustics research.</p>
<h1 id="overview-of-_koe_-workflow">Overview of <em>Koe</em> workflow</h1>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
<p>We designed the <em>Koe</em>  workflow to be intuitive and flexible. Here is a suggested workflow:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/w4tNkZ5/workflow-SMALL.png" alt="Koe workflow"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Import</strong> raw recordings and divide into “songs” (vocalisation bouts), then <strong>segment songs</strong> into their constituent acoustic units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can <strong>extract acoustic features</strong> from units. These features are used to calculate unit similarity and expedite classification in two ways: through interactive ordination, and similarity indices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interactive ordination</strong> is a major time saver for classification. The user can encircle groups of points on the ordination to see spectrograms, hear playback, and bulk-label groups of units. Harnessing the interactive ordination in conjunction with human audio-visual perception, this technique offers a major advance in both speed and robustness over existing acoustic classification methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Units can also be viewed as an <strong>interactive unit table</strong>. A key feature of the unit table is the <strong>similarity index</strong>, which lets you sort by acoustic similarity. Because similar-sounding units are grouped together, units can easily be selected in bulk and classified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>catalogue of class exemplars</strong> is generated automatically, displaying up to 10 randomly chosen exemplars for each class, which serves as a useful reference during classification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Koe</em> gives you full control of your databases, allowing you to <strong>add collaborators</strong> and set permission levels. This makes it straightforward to conduct a classification validation experiment: grant judges labelling access to your database, and once they have independently classified the units, compile their labels to examine concordance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once units have been classified, songs can be visualised as sequences of unit labels; you can filter by sequence to identify all instances of a specific song type, for example. You can also <strong>mine sequence structure</strong> in detail with association rule algorithms and network visualisations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Export data</strong> from any program view as csv.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In <em>Koe</em>, on the left of the screen is a sidebar with program controls. At the top of the sidebar are User account controls for logging out / switching user; beneath that are controls specific to the active view. And beneath that is the workflow navigation pane with buttons to access different program views, labelled according to their function.</p>

<p>Changes are saved to the database as soon as they happen. If you want to be able to revert to a previous state you will want to save database restore points.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click on <em>Manage your database</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the round checkbox of the database you want to set a restore point for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Quick save</strong> or <strong>Full save</strong> at the bottom of the window to create a restore point. <strong>Quick save</strong> saves label data associated with each unit. <strong>Full save</strong> saves both label data and segmentation start/end points.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Please note</strong></em> that restore points do not affect which songs are in the database or which units are segmented. For example, if you make a save and then delete songs, reverting will not restore the songs to the database. Similarly, if you add songs, reverting will not remove the added songs. In the same way, if you add/delete units, reverting will not remove/restore the segmentation. What reverting <em>will</em> do is restore the label data and (for a full save) the segmentation start/end points for <em>currently existing</em> units. If you want to preserve all aspects of a database at a certain point, like a traditional &lsquo;Save As&rsquo;, then copy everything to a new database, as described in <a href="#copy-songs-to-another-database">Copy songs to another database</a> below.</p>

<p>Some bioacoustics researchers work with looong recordings (e.g. passive acoustic monitoring). Very large files can be cumbersome. But don&rsquo;t worry! Yukio Fukuzawa has heard your cries and has come galloping to our rescue with a simple tool for automatically splitting large wav files into smaller wav files. You specify how long you want the audio sections to be, and how many seconds of overlap between sections.</p>
<p>To run the tool you will need to install Python. After that it&rsquo;s just a simple line of code that you type into your command prompt.</p>
<p>The tool and instructions are found here: <a href="https://github.com/fzyukio/split-songs">https://github.com/fzyukio/split-songs</a></p>
<h1 id="segment-songs-into-units">Segment songs into units</h1>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
<p>This section describes how to segment songs into acoustic units. However, if you have already segmented units using other software, jump to the <a href="#import-unit-segmentation-from-csv">next section</a></p>
<p>On the navigation pane, click <em>View all songs</em>. You will see your list of songs; click on a song filename to open the song.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fvvjKJ5/Click-a-filename.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Much like the previous program view, you can play the song and adjust spectrogram appearance and playback speed. Drag over units on the spectrogram to segment. Mouse over a selection box to highlight that unit’s row in the table. Click a selection box for playback. Fill in annotation columns as desired. Then click <strong>Save segmentation</strong> to save to the database.</p>
<p><em><strong>You can return to this view to alter segmentation at any time</strong></em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note: a <em>Koe</em> user interested in comparing entire songs as units for analysis can still use the software by selecting songs rather than syllables as units and classifying them using interactive ordination / unit tables. In a future update, we hope to offer both unit- and song-level comparisons simultaneously, so that a user does not have to choose.</strong></em></p>

<p>(Note that start/end times are measured in ms from the start of the file. E.g. a unit with <em>start</em> column value of 680 and <em>end</em> column value of 750 means the unit begins 680 ms and ends at 750 ms from the start of the file.

<p>Most of these features are frame-based, with the result that units of different lengths are represented by unequal-length feature sequences. It is therefore necessary to aggregate these sequences to arrive at the same dimensional representation for each unit, so that units can be compared.

<h1 id="construct-ordination">Construct ordination</h1>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
<p><em>Koe</em> can produce interactive two- or three-dimensional ordination plots, based on the unit features extracted in the previous step. Notably, two-dimensional plots can be used to classify units directly on the plot, which greatly expedites the classification process (see next section). To construct an ordination, go to <strong>Extract features and compare &gt; Construct ordination</strong> and choose a data matrix from the Existing data matrices dropdown list (1).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9yYhTSD/Construct-Ordination3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Choose an ordination method (2): <strong>PCA</strong> (Principal Components Analysis), <strong>ICA</strong> (Independent Component Analysis) or <strong>t-SNE</strong> (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) with PCA prepocessing. Since t-SNE preserves local structure in the data, it is particularly effective for defining and discriminating between different clusters.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: t-SNE is controlled by two parameters, &lsquo;perplexity&rsquo;, which can be set to any value between 5 and 50, and number of iterations. By default, perplexity is set to 10 and number of iterations (n_iter) is set to 4000. There is no &lsquo;correct&rsquo; value of perplexity &ndash; you must experiment with different values to achieve best results. If the perplexity value you choose is too high or low, you will find points on the plot do not cluster well by similarity, and will form convoluted banding patterns. To change the value, type, e.g. <strong>perplexity=30</strong> in the <strong>Extra parameters</strong> box. The numbers of iterations should be adequate in most cases at 4000, but you can change this  by typing, e.g. <strong>n_iter=5000</strong> in the <strong>Extra parameters</strong> box. To control both parameters, separate with a comma as in <strong>perplexity=30, n_iter=5000</strong>.</p>
<p>Choose (3) the desired number of dimensions: two or three. Then click <strong>Submit</strong> (4). The <em>Koe</em> server will process your request and send a notification email when your ordination construction job finishes. (Typically this will take only a few minutes).</p>
<p>For more tips on optimising your t-SNE ordination in <strong>Koe</strong>, see <a href="https://github.com/fzyukio/koe/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-do-i-get-my-tsne-ordination-to-cluster-nicely">this FAQ</a></p>
<h1 id="view-interactive-ordination-and-classify-units">View interactive ordination and classify units</h1>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
<p>Click <strong>Classify &amp; manage units &gt; Ordination</strong>. If you have constructed several ordinations, choose the one you want from the Current ordination dropdown list in the active view controls on the side bar.
For 2D ordinations, a plot will be generated like the below.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/JRNBgGf/Ordination-view-small.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The plot is controlled by a toolbar at the top left of the plot:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Kh7MqC6/Plot-buttons.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With the lasso tool (selected by default), encircle groups of points on the plot to see their spectrograms. Mousing over a point in a selection highlights the corresponding spectrogram in the left-hand panel. Click a point on the plot or its spectrogram for audio.</p>
<p>Classify selections in bulk by clicking <strong>Label</strong> beneath the spectrograms pane. You can label at up to three levels of granularity.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/QXn4y1b/Label-button-in-ordination-view.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you add more classes, they each acquire a distinctive point type. Toggle class visibility by clicking the legend, zoom the plot (with the zoom tool) for more refined detail.</p>
<p>You can also view selections as an interactive unit table by clicking <strong>View table</strong>. More information on the unit table below.</p>
<h1 id="calculate-similarity">Calculate similarity</h1>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
<p>A second method for expediting classification is to use unit similarity indices. In the unit table (below) the similarity index is used to sort your units by spectral similarity, assisting rapid manual classification by grouping syllables in clusters that can be labelled in bulk.</p>
<p>You have two input options for calculating a similarity index: one is to use an extracted feature set, and the other is to use the coordinates of a constructed ordination. Go to <strong>Extract features and compare &gt; Calculate similarity</strong> and select an option from Existing data matrices (for the former option) or Existing ordinations (for the latter).  For optimal results we recommend using an existing t-SNE ordination as the input for the similarity index. Then click <strong>Submit</strong>. The <em>Koe</em> server will process your request and send a notification email when your similarity calculation job finishes. (Typically this will take only a few minutes).</p>

<p>Much like in <em>Excel</em>, you can click on a cell to select it, or move around the grid with the arrow keys. <code>Page Up</code> and <code>Page Down</code> will page through one screen-height at a time. To hear a syllable, simply click on its spectrogram, or press <code>spacebar</code> with spectrogram cell selected. There is a speed slider at the top of the sidebar for slowing down playback; this helps our human ears hear details not apparent at full speed. Single-click on a cell to select cell contents (e.g. to copy to the clipboard), or double-click on a cell to alter cell content, if it is editable (editable cells contain a pencil icon).</p>

<p>If you change &lsquo;sex&rsquo; or &lsquo;species&rsquo; column info associated with an individual animal, the changes will be reflected for all rows in the table belonging to that individual (you may need to refresh your browser to see the change propagate). This prevents mistakes, such as the same individual being ascribed male sex in some rows and female sex in other rows. It also means you only have to enter sex and species information for an individual in one row.</p>
<p>A future <em>Koe</em> update will allow a user to add custom annotation columns, such as a species column. In the meantime a user can simply co-opt one of the existing annotation columns for their purposes, such as labelling species.</p>

<h2 id="classifying">Classifying</h2>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
<p>Units can have three sets of labels at once, using the three label columns: Label, Subfamily and Family. You can use these to label at different scales, e.g. fine-scale, intermediate-scale and broad-scale classification. Or you may choose to use these columns for other purposes.</p>
<p>Select multiple rows of the same type by clicking their checkboxes or pressing spacebar with the checkbox cell selected. When you have finished selecting rows, press <code>Ctrl+Shift+L</code> to bulk label all selected rows at the fine-scale level. <code>Ctrl+Shift+F</code> bulk labels at the broad-scale “Family” level, and <code>Ctrl+Shift+S</code> bulk labels at the intermediate “Subfamily” level.</p>
<p>Alternatively, click the menu button on the right-hand side of the <strong>Label</strong>, <strong>Subfamily</strong> or <strong>Family</strong> column header and select <strong>Bulk set value</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/X4Mb8SV/Set-Label2.png" alt="">
A dialogue box will appear:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/6rRVYxX/SetLabel.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you are creating a new class, type any new name you like. If you are adding a group of units to a pre-existing class, then start typing the name of the class and it will appear in the dropdown list. The numbers beside each label class in the dropdown list indicate how many instances of that class there are in the dataset. Click the correct class name on the list, then click Set. All selected rows will now have this label.</p>
<p>Note that after labelling, all selected rows will remain selected. You can un-select all rows quickly with <code>Ctrl</code>+`</p>
<p>You can also classify an individual unit by double-clicking the label, subfamily or family cell and typing a string. If the label class already exists you will see it in the dropdown list. Click the list item you want, or use <code>Alt+Down</code> to navigate down the list and <code>Enter</code> to select:</p>

<h1 id="exemplars">Exemplars</h1>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
<p>Every new label class you create gets automatically added to the <strong>Exemplars</strong> view, which functions as a class catalogue to reference during classification. This view has one row per type, with up to 10 randomly-selected exemplars for each row. Go to <strong>Classify &amp; manage units &gt; Exemplars</strong> to see your exemplars. Click on spectrograms to play the sound, and change playback speed with the speed slider, just as in other views. Click <strong>Next 10 random exemplars</strong> to randomly select the next batch.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gTPWXNQ/exemplars-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can have <em>Koe</em> open in as many tabs or windows as you want, so it’s easy to have exemplars in one tab and unit table in another, to help you label by comparison. If you make changes in one tab, refresh your other tabs to see the changes.</p>
<h1 id="filtering-data">Filtering data</h1>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
<p>The filter box at the top of each program view is a quick and powerful way to filter your data. It takes regular expressions (see <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/regex.htm">https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/regex.htm</a> for a crash course on using regex), but it can also be used simply with no technical expertise. Simply mouse over a column header, click the dropdown arrow that appears, and select <strong>Filter</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/mhG32KG/Using-the-filter.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then type the string you want to filter by. For example, in the unit table, to filter rows with a certain label, click the <strong>Label</strong> column dropdown and click <strong>Filter</strong>, then type a string, e.g.</p>
<p><code>label: crazysqueak</code></p>
<p>You can also filter by multiple columns at once, separated by semicolons.
<code>label: crazysqueak; song: BobtheBat_1</code></p>
<p>To filter date columns (i.e. <strong>Date of record</strong> and <strong>Added</strong> columns), use the format <code>from(yyyy-mm-dd)to(yyyy-mm-dd)</code>, like this: <code>date: from(2015-01-01)to(2018-12-31)</code></p>
<p>To filter numerical columns, such as ID, use <code>==</code> for &lsquo;exactly&rsquo;, <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> for &lsquo;greater than&rsquo; and &lsquo;less than&rsquo;, respectively.</p>
<p><code>^</code> indicates the start of a string, and <code>$</code> indicates the end; for example, 
<code>label: squeak</code> 
will return rows with ‘squeak’ anywhere in the label, such as ‘crazysqueak’, ‘squeaky’, ‘upsqueak’.</p>
<p><code>label: ^squeak</code>
will return rows beginning  with ‘squeak’, such as ‘squeaky’.</p>
<p><code>label: squeak$</code>
will return rows ending  with ‘squeak’, such as ‘crazysqueak’, ‘upsqueak’.</p>
<p><code>label: ^squeak$</code>
will return rows with exactly ‘squeak’ (nothing before or after).</p>
<p><code>label: ^$</code>
is a handy way of finding rows with blank labels.</p>

<p>Click on <strong>View all songs</strong>. Here you can see all your songs, with one row per song. You will see the song sequence structure as a sequence of unit labels.</p>
<p>To illustrate, the figure below shows a song (upper panel) and how it is represented in <strong>View all songs</strong> as a string of labels (lower panel).</p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/QkDJnqk/Songs-view-click-on-unit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Click the play button at the start of a sequence to play the entire song. Use the filter to search for songs of a particular unit sequence, e.g.
<code>sequence:&quot;trill&quot;-&quot;dragon&quot;</code>
will filter for all songs with a <code>trill</code> unit immediately followed by a <code>dragon</code> unit. This is useful for finding songs with a shared pattern and exploring syntax.</p>

<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
<p>As one way of exploring rules that may govern song structure (i.e. syntax), <em>Koe</em> uses the cSPADE (constrained Sequential Pattern Discovery using Equivalence classes) algorithm (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007652502315">Zaki, 2001</a>) to discover commonly-occurring sequences in a set of songs.</p>
<p>We  consider a sequence to be an ordered list of acoustic units denoted as <code>A⇒B⇒C⇒...⇒x</code>.</p>
<p>A sequence rule has two parts: a left side (what comes before) and a right side (what follows). The rule states that when the left side occurs, the right side follows</p>
<p><code>[Left side]</code>⇒<code>[Right side]</code></p>
<p>For example, take <code>A⇒B</code> ⇒ <code>C</code>. 
This rule states that when the sequence <code>A⇒B</code> occurs, <code>C</code> comes next.</p>
<p>The left side can be a sequence of any length, but in our current implementation the right side is always one unit long For example:</p>
<p><code>A</code>⇒<code>B</code> 
(when <code>A</code> occurs, <code>B</code> comes next)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>A⇒B⇒C⇒D⇒E⇒F⇒G⇒H⇒I</code>⇒<code>J</code>
(when <code>A⇒B⇒C⇒D⇒E⇒F⇒G⇒H⇒I</code> occurs, <code>J</code> comes next).</p>
<p>We plan to relax this restriction in a future update to allow chains of units on the right side.</p>
<p>The cSPADE algorithm calculates the credibility of sequence rules. Credible rules have a large <em>confidence factor</em>, a large level of <em>support</em> and a value of <em>lift</em> greater than one (as defined below). Let&rsquo;s take the example rule <code>A⇒B</code> ⇒ <code>C</code></p>
<p><strong>Support</strong>: The level of support is the proportion of songs in the database that contain the entire sequence <code>A⇒B⇒C</code> at least once.</p>
<p><strong>Confidence</strong>: The strength of an association is defined by its confidence factor (hereafter ‘confidence’), which is the proportion of those songs containing <code>A⇒B</code> that also contain <code>A⇒B⇒C</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Lift</strong>: Lift is a measure of the strength of the association <em>relative to chance</em>. It is equal to the confidence of the rule, divided by the proportion of songs containing the right side. Thus it gives the <em>ratio</em> of (i) the proportion of songs the transition from  <code>A⇒B</code>⇒<code>C</code> occurs in, <em>versus</em> (ii) the proportion of songs expected to contain <code>A⇒B</code>⇒<code>C</code> by chance association.</p>
<p>Think of our example rule, <code>A⇒B</code>⇒<code>C</code>. Imagine a dataset with 100 songs, where 10 of those songs contain <code>A⇒B</code>, 7 contain <code>A⇒B⇒C</code>, and 20 songs contain <code>C</code>.</p>
<p>The <em>support</em> is <strong>0.07</strong> (i.e. <code>A⇒B⇒C</code> occurs in 7/100 songs). The <em>confidence</em> is <strong>0.7</strong> (i.e . <code>A⇒B⇒C</code> occurs in 7/10 songs containing <code>A⇒B</code>). The <em>lift</em> is the confidence (0.7) divided by the proportion of songs containing <code>C</code> (0.2), which is <strong>3.5</strong>. In other words, the association <code>A⇒B</code>⇒<code>C</code> occurs in 3.5 times as many songs as expected by chance association of <code>A⇒B</code> and <code>C</code>.</p>
<p>To demonstrate cSPADE with real data, consider the ten songs shown in the figure below to be a population of songs.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/5xJ6y8C/Half-of-Song-View.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The rule</p>
<p><code>Stutter⇒Waah(magpie)</code> ⇒ <code>Pipe(B6)</code></p>
<p>has a <em>support</em> of 0.4 since the entire sequence occurs in four of the 10 songs. The rule has a <em>confidence</em> of 0.8, because in four of the five songs that contain <code>Stutter⇒Waah(magpie)</code>, the transition to <code>Pipe(B6)</code> occurs.  The proportion of songs with <code>Pipe(B6)</code> is 0.6, so the <em>lift</em> of this rule is 0.8/0.6=1.33. That is, the association <code>Stutter⇒Waah(magpie)</code> ⇒ <code>Pipe(B6)</code> occurs in 1.33 times as many songs as expected by chance association of <code>Stutter⇒Waah(magpie)</code> and <code>Pipe(B6)</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/QpyGwQj/c-SPADEand-Network-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Two-unit associations from cSPADE can be visualised using a directed network. The network models the direction and strength of association between pairs of units, across a population of songs. Units are represented by nodes (vertices) which are joined by lines (edges) if the units occur consecutively (by default <em>Koe</em> shows only those sequences that occur in at least 1% of songs).  The order of units is indicated by arrow direction, and strength of association between units (lift) is represented by edge thickness. Visually cluttered networks can be simplified using the filter, e.g. to show only associations with high lift.</p>

<p>You can export the data from each program view as a CSV file by clicking <strong>Export entire table (csv)</strong> or <strong>Export filtered subset (csv)</strong> on the active controls pane. The format of exported tables matches how the data appears in <em>Koe</em>; for example, data exported from the <em>Unit table</em> view will match the column and row order of the unit table as it appears in <em>Koe</em>.</p>
<h1 id="copy-songs-to-another-database">Copy songs to another database</h1>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
<p>First make sure you have created the database which you want to copy songs to. Then, under <strong>View all songs</strong>, select the songs you want to copy (1), and click <strong>Copy to another database</strong> (2). Type the name of the database to copy to (3) then click <strong>Yes</strong> (4)</p>

<h1 id="make-database-subsets-collections">Make database subsets (collections)</h1>
<p><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
<p>You can make collections of units as convenient subsets for analysis. Under <strong>Classify &amp; manage units &gt; Unit table</strong>, select all the units you want to be in the collection, then click <strong>Make a Collection from selected units</strong> on the active controls pane. Type a name for the collection, then click <strong>Set</strong>. Note the Collection name must be unique; if the collection name has already been created (by any users, not just you), the name will not &lsquo;take&rsquo;. Also note that a Collection is not separate from the parent database – any changes you make to the Collection will be reflected in the parent database. Therefore you should take care when naming the collection so that you will remember which parent it belongs to. You can rename and delete collections under <strong>Manage your database</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to create a subset that you can modify independently from the parent database, go to <strong>View all songs</strong> and copy songs to another database. Then you can edit freely without affecting the original database. To achieve this, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="#create-a-new-database">Create a new database</a> under <em>Manage your database</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to <em>View all songs</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the <strong>Current database</strong> dropdown list on the controls pane, choose the database you want to copy songs <em>from</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the songs you want to copy by checking their checkboxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Copy to another database</strong> on the active controls pane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type the name of the newly created database you want to copy songs <em>to</em>.</p>
