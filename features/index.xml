      <description>Spectral Flux Is the measure of the changes in the shape of the spectrum over time. SF is computed as the Euclidean ($L^2$) distance of two consecutive spectral frames with normalised PSD
Spectral Slope For many natural audio signals, the energy of the spectrum tends to decrease towards the higher end of the frequency range, the &amp;ldquo;slope&amp;rdquo; of which is related to the nature of the sound source. This parameter can be found via linear regression of the magnitude: $$x(f) = slope \times f + intercept$$ where $x(f)$ is the magnitude function and $f$ is the frequency value.</description>

      <description>The time domain represents changes in the signal over time, or more precisely, the changes in air pressure when the sound reaches a microphone, which is measured by voltage value. Features in this category are necessarily extracted directly from the oscillogram without any transformation. Thus, they tend to have excellent time resolution and low computational cost.
Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR) Defined as the number of zero crossings within one second is an efficient way to approximate the dominant frequency</description>
